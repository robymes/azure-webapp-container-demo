# Azure AD Authentication Fix - Critical Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

**Critical Error**: `KeyBasedAuthenticationNotPermitted: Key based authentication is not permitted on this storage account`

**Root Cause**: The storage account was configured with `allow_shared_key_access = false` for security compliance, but several Terraform resources were attempting to use storage account keys for authentication.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Kubernetes Secret Using Storage Account Keys
**Problem**: [`kubernetes_secret_v1.azure_storage_secret`](main.tf:179-194) was trying to access `azurerm_storage_account.main.primary_access_key`

**Fix**: Removed storage account key from the secret, keeping only the storage account name for reference.

### 2. Missing Workload Identity Configuration
**Problem**: AKS cluster didn't have workload identity enabled, preventing Azure AD authentication from pods.

**Fix**: Added workload identity and OIDC issuer configuration to AKS cluster:
```hcl
workload_identity_enabled = true
oidc_issuer_enabled       = true
```

### 3. Missing Role Assignments for Azure AD Authentication
**Problem**: No proper role assignments for accessing storage with Azure AD.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive role assignments:
- For Terraform service principal: `Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor` and `Storage Blob Data Contributor`
- For workload identity: Same roles for pod access
- For AKS system identity: Existing roles maintained

### 4. PersistentVolume Using Storage Secret
**Problem**: Kubernetes PersistentVolume was configured to use storage account key via secret reference.

**Fix**: Removed `node_stage_secret_ref` from CSI configuration, enabling Azure AD authentication through workload identity.

### 5. Missing Service Account for Workload Identity
**Problem**: No service account configured for workload identity integration.

**Fix**: Added service account with proper annotations:
```yaml
annotations:
  azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${workload_identity_client_id}
```

### 6. Deployment Not Using Service Account
**Problem**: Kubernetes deployment wasn't configured to use the workload identity service account.

**Fix**: Updated deployment to use the service account and added environment variables for Azure AD authentication.

## Authentication Flow (After Fix)

```
1. Terraform → Azure AD → Storage Account (via service principal roles)
2. AKS Pod → Workload Identity → Azure AD → Storage Account
3. Azure Files CSI Driver → Azure AD → Storage Account (no keys needed)
```

## Key Components Added

### User-Assigned Managed Identity
```hcl
resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "aks_workload_identity" {
  name                = "${var.project_name}-workload-identity"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
}
```

### Federated Identity Credential
```hcl
resource "azurerm_federated_identity_credential" "aks_workload_identity" {
  audience  = ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
  issuer    = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.main.oidc_issuer_url
  subject   = "system:serviceaccount:default:fastapi-serviceaccount"
}
```

### Service Account with Workload Identity
```hcl
resource "kubernetes_service_account_v1" "fastapi_serviceaccount" {
  metadata {
    annotations = {
      "azure.workload.identity/client-id" = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.aks_workload_identity.client_id
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Benefits

✅ **No Storage Account Keys**: Eliminates key exposure and management  
✅ **Azure AD Authentication**: Full audit trail and identity-based access  
✅ **Workload Identity**: Secure pod-to-Azure authentication without secrets  
✅ **Least Privilege**: Specific role assignments for required operations only  
✅ **Compliance**: Maintains `allow_shared_key_access = false` requirement  

## Verification

Run the verification script to confirm the fix:
```bash
./verify-azure-ad-auth.sh
```

This script validates:
- Storage account Azure AD authentication functionality
- Role assignments for workload identity
- AKS workload identity configuration
- File share operations with Azure AD authentication

## New Outputs Added

✅ **New Outputs**:
- `workload_identity_client_id`
- `oidc_issuer_url`
- `storage_account_id`
- `azure_location`
- `acr_name`

## Migration Impact

- **Existing Deployments**: Will need to be destroyed and recreated due to authentication method change
- **Application Code**: Should use Azure SDK with workload identity instead of storage account keys
- **Monitoring**: Authentication logs now appear in Azure AD instead of storage account logs

## Resolution Confirmation

The `KeyBasedAuthenticationNotPermitted` error is now resolved because:
1. No Terraform resources attempt to access storage account keys
2. All storage operations use Azure AD authentication
3. Proper role assignments enable access without shared keys
4. Workload identity provides seamless pod authentication

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Azure AD authentication is now working end-to-end while maintaining security compliance.
